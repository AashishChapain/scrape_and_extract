"Patients seen this way showed a variety of symptoms and this method helped decide which cases may be more appropriate for an urgent care setting or perhaps even a referral back to primary care."There were automations built within our existing Microsoft Teams platform that allowed for seamless tele-triage screenings to be initiated by triage nurses in our ED," he continued. "We have other use-case scenarios."PROPOSALMore innovative use cases involved looking at the increasing demands for psychiatric/behavioral health services up against increasingly taxed provider resources. These fluctuations and increases in needs for behavioral health services both at the peak of the pandemic and to date are well documented nationally. The Southcoast region has been no exception to these challenges."Both the selection and upcoming implementation of the Neuroflow platform at Southcoast Health is a strategic effort to leverage digital technology to help our behavioral health providers and staff remotely manage the growing and currently underserved behavioral health needs across Southcoast patients," Feen explained."We view Neuroflow as an enabling technology to risk stratify patients in real time who need care interventions based on patient interaction with various assessments that are offered within this platform," he continued.Starting this fall, the platform will enable the behavioral health providers and staff to remotely identify and take targeted action to avoid behavioral health crises before they happen through Neuroflow\'s digital feedback loop and intervention support tools, he added."Our primary goal with this tool is enabling broader surveillance with patients using the technology to remotely identify patients who need targeted behavioral care in the moment, without requiring traditional face-to-face visits and/or telehealth visits if determined clinically appropriate by the patient\'s care team," Feen said."While the goal is to manage more patients remotely by targeting patients with highest risk factors who need intervention the most, a secondary goal of the tool is to avoid unnecessary ED visits and/or acute care for patients who are successfully managed before the onset of an acute event," he added.In an entirely different space, a building block toward the health system\'s hospital-at-home effort is its remote patient monitoring capability with colleagues in the Southcoast Visiting Nurse Association."While hospital-at-home is not a formalized program at Southcoast quite yet', ' HITRUST certified', 'Imprint\nAds info\n      © 2023 X Corp']
