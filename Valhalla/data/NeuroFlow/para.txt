Future research will be key to enhancing behavioral health technology and integration to further improve patient outcomes and reduce emergency department utilization.Stats at a glance:See related case studyClick to view studySummary: The use of measurement-based care in integrated care settings offers a means to address existing treatment gaps for individuals with mental health disorders seeking care. Findings from this study demonstrate the large-scale feasibility (n > 4,000) of remotely collecting mental health data via a mobile technology platform and that changes in depression and anxiety symptoms, including suicidal ideation, can be reliably assessed. Findings further revealed that digitally-enabled measurement-based care (MBC) supported patients experiencing moderate, moderately severe, or severe depression or anxiety in achieving clinically and statistically significant symptom improvements.Stats at a glance:See related research: Counselor and student perceptions of an mHealth technology platform used in a school counseling settingClick to view studySummary: The ability to risk stratify a patient population to inform population level interventions is key to efficient, high quality, measurement-based care. Current methodologies focus predominantly on validated assessments alone, without consideration of other qualitative measures of symptom impact on functionality. This study details the development of the NeuroFlow Severity Score (NFSS) and evaluates its utility for population level risk stratification when compared to the Personal Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) and Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7), and expert clinician review.  Based on over 35,000 NeuroFlow users, the NFSS demonstrates the simultaneous credibility and clinical validity of a comprehensive single risk index while reducing effort and burden for clinicians.Stats at a glance:Be sure to check this page regularly for our latest updates regarding our ongoing research efforts!Terms of Service | BAA | Privacy Policy | CCPA | SubprocessorsCopyright © NeuroFlow. 2022.

NeuroFlow’s market-leading solution provides the technology and staffing to successfully implement sustainable collaborative care at scaleThe Psychiatric Collaborative Care Model (CoCM) is the most effective evidence-based integrated care model for behavioral health, validated by more than 90 randomized controlled trials. CoCM enables a holistic team-based approach to treating common mental health conditions by integrating behavioral health professionals into the care team, while simultaneously increasing the confidence and competence of physical health providers in treating these disorders.While the clinical effectiveness of CoCM in managing higher acuity patients is backed by years of research, it traditionally comes with high costs and a long ramp-up time. NeuroFlow’s solution for CoCM combines technology and services to drive results quickly and cost-effectively.Implementation and scaling of services is impeded by challenges in hiring  behavioral health care managers and psychiatric consultants.  Staffing is expensive and difficult due to provider shortages, training, and ramp up.Manual referral processes impede filling CoCM caseloads, causing behavioral teams to be underutilized and creating financial burden to the organization.Static tools like spreadsheets serve as the home for patient tracking and management, making collaboration difficult and scaling inefficient.Paper-and-pencil approach means PCPs are manually uploading assessment data to EHRs and reviewing treatment recommendations outside their usual systems.Staffing support with experienced behavioral health care managers and psychiatric consultants takes burden off your teams and allows for immediate implementation and scaling.App-based remote universal assessments rapidly identify CoCM-appropriate patients, and targeted bulk patient invitations fill your caseload from day one.Our cloud-based registry enables real-time collaboration and management of your patient panel with straightforward time-tracking and documentation, making scaling your CoCM program easier and more efficient.EHR integrations and comprehensive reporting keep PCPs informed within their existing workflows.increase in caseload capacityreduction in time to responsecare team satisfaction using NeuroFlow*NeuroFlow measures clinical and engagement outcome metrics as evidence for the efficacy of our solution, based on internal data (n>146,000)“The last thing I wanted to do was to have a patient in a waiting room fill out a screening tool, give it to someone at the front office, have them score it, enter it into the EHR, and then expect the PCP to see that before they go in and meet the patient…Now we are doing outreach to 30,000 people which helps us identify people who actually meet the criteria for treatment before they come into the office, which is ideal.”– John Eiler, System VP of Behavioral Services at Health FirstRead MoreCollaborative care is a model of integrated care that was developed at the University of Washington AIMS Center to treat mental health conditions like depression and anxiety which require regular follow-up due to their persistent nature. Collaborative care focuses on defined populations that are tracked within a registry and leverages a care team made up of primary care providers, behavioral health care managers, and psychiatric consultants, who provide evidence-based, brief interventions and prescribe medication when necessary.Over 90 randomized trials have proven collaborative care to be one of the most effective ways to treat diverse populations that have a variety of behavioral health and comorbid medical conditions, enhancing both mental and physical well-being.Collaborative care requires new workflows and team members. In a typical medical care scenario, the treatment team has two members, the primary care provider (PCP) and the patient. In collaborative care, there are two additional roles, the behavioral health care manager (BHCM) and the psychiatric consult. These additional care team members are critical for closing the gap between physical and mental health care, ensuring behavioral health conditions are not left untreated as is often the case in primary care settings.The primary care provider determines whether the patient should be enrolled in collaborative care based on behavioral health symptoms, medications needs, or the patient’s level of support. Treating behavioral health conditions in a primary care setting improves access for patients who already have an existing relationship with their PCP.The PCP then introduces the patient to the BHCM who will conduct regular, brief interventions with the patients. These interventions include conducting validated assessments like the PHQ-9 for depression or GAD-7 for anxiety as well evidence-based therapies like cognitive-based therapy (CBT).In addition to communicating with the PCP and patient regularly, the BHCM also works with a psychiatric consultant to determine prescription needs and adjust the care plan based on patient outcomes. The care manager and psychiatric consult collaborate through a patient registry to effectively manage the patient caseload and monitor the population. This workflow makes it easier to identify, treat, and monitor patients who have behavioral health conditions within a primary care setting and drives significantly improved outcomes. In the groundbreaking IMPACT Study, collaborative care doubled the effectiveness of depression treatment for older adults in the primary care setting.According to the University of Washington AIMS Center, there are five core components of the collaborative care model, and each element must be in place in order to deliver effective care to the patient population.The patient must be at the center of the care team to deliver high-quality collaborative care. Providing both physical and mental health care through a single care team is comfortable and convenient for the patient and improves engagement. Greater patient engagement leads to a better health care experience and improved patient outcomes.Collaborative care is delivered across a population to ensure no individual falls through the cracks. A patient registry enables care teams to track every patient in the population and identify when behavioral health conditions worsen and regular interventions are required.Also known as stepped care, measurement-based treatment to target means that patients have a specific goal or clinical outcome to reach through collaborative care, such as a score that’s 10 or lower on a PHQ-9 assessment. Treatment plans are measured against those results and change if a patient’s behavioral health is not improving.Collaborative care provides treatments that are backed by credible research, including evidence-based therapies like cognitive-based therapy (CBT) and problem-solving treatment (PST). The care manager delivers these therapies in the form of brief interventions, taking the burden of care off the PCP.Collaborative care can be billed through a fee-for-service arrangement using CPT codes. CoCM is also compatible with a value-based care billing model. In that arrangement, providers are reimbursed for the quality of care and clinical outcomes, not just the volume of care provided.CoCM programs are inherently patient-centric because they are proven to increase patient engagement by treating physical and behavioral health together. Providers empower patients to set goals for themselves and to make sure those goals are communicated to every member of the care team. For patients, goals should be about improving their lives—not just their diagnosis.Patients work directly with their behavioral health care managers to set their personal goals so that clear communication is formed at the onset of the program. The care manager discusses the patient’s desires with the psychiatric consultant who then uses this information to provide patient-focused recommendations to the medical provider.A patient-centric program should also provide behavioral health resources, such as digital health content, that patients can explore outside of a healthcare setting. Some collaborative care technology solutions offer patients tools to track their well-being or self-guided dCBT curricula. These collaborative care platforms provide diverse options for patients to manage their behavioral health in a way that works best for them.Implementing collaborative care requires significant upfront investment of time and resources to establish new workflows, train staff, and invest in the technology necessary to manage population-wide data. The right technology can streamline workflows and create the necessary connections between an EHR and the patient registry so that no patient is overlooked.Technology can also empower care teams to deliver assessments and treatment remotely to a much larger population and personalize care plans based on patient engagement and scores. For example, a digital collaborative care solution can quickly identify an individual’s depression symptoms, flag that patient in the registry for the care team, and immediately deliver customized depression content so that the patient receives timely support.After a patient completes collaborative care, behavioral health technology can continue to engage that patient with evidence-based content and monitor well-being over time. This is incredibly valuable if a patient relapses in between primary care visits. When a patient’s well-being declines, the primary care provider is alerted immediately, and the patient receives the appropriate level of care before symptoms worsen.Learn more about NeuroFlow’s high-tech and high-touch approach to collaborative care here.Request your demo today to see NeuroFlow in action!Terms of Service | BAA | Privacy Policy | CCPA | SubprocessorsCopyright © NeuroFlow. 2022.

Utilizing measurement-based care in behavioral health is a proven approach to improve outcomes, reduce costs, and enhance clinical workflowsMeasurement-based care (MBC) can be defined as the practice of basing clinical care on data collected throughout treatment. MBC is considered a core component of numerous evidence-based practices and frameworks that can be added to any treatment.Traditional physical health has measurement, and so should behavioral health.DiabetesTreatment: Insulin, Dietary Changes, Medication.Heart DiseaseTreatment: Medical Procedures, Exercise, Stress Management.Anxiety & DepressionTreatment: CBT, Integrated Care, Mindfulness, Medication.NeuroFlow derives insights from assessment results and other key data points to help you better understand your population and support their care journey. NeuroFlow’s engaging digital experience helps increase screening rates while delivering personalized and relevant content to meet individual needs.IdentifySurface behavioral health conditions proactively before they escalateTriageEmpower care teams with the best next steps for care based on a combination of data pointsManageEnhance care team productivity and collaboration with the data they need to best support patientsIn behavioral health, MBC is powered by validated rating scales which take the form of brief questionnaires. These are often administered to patients at intake and periodically throughout their treatment. Questionnaires allow clinicians to understand how a patient is progressing and whether there is remission in conditions like depression or anxiety.Rating scales typically screen for a specific behavioral health condition like anxiety or depression. Some common rating scales include:GAD-7 – Generalized Anxiety Disorder scalePHQ-9 – Patient Health Questionnaire, depression moduleWHO-5 – World Health Organization 5 Well-Being IndexAt NeuroFlow, we provide over 20 questionnaires, including those listed above. We also measure other forms of patient-generated data that inform well-being, like sleep and mood ratings. We’re constantly adding more assessment capabilities to our platform to improve insights for care providers and better engage the individuals who use our platform.Regular measurement of patients’ behavioral health means more timely interventions and better treatment. That leads to fewer behavioral health crises and improved well-being for patients. Specifically, MBC improves behavioral healthcare in the following ways:Having a standard, clinically-vetted rating scale translates certain subjective experiences into measurable data that care providers can act on. Not all behavioral health indicators can be quantified in this way, but establishing a baseline and having a standard frame of reference helps care providers more easily assess the severity of behavioral health conditions.With greater insight into patients’ behavioral health, care providers can offer more effective and personalized treatment and share insights across care teams. MBC insights can help determine medication dosage, intervention plans, or match patients with the right care provider.When MBC is done right, care providers regularly engage their patients which improves the quantity and quality of data collection. This can help providers deliver interventions earlier and provide more effective preventative care. It also means patients can receive the right resources and tools to drive improved self-care in between appointments.Despite the benefits, many care providers struggle to embrace MBC when managing the behavioral health of their populations. According to research from the Kaiser Permanente Washington Health Research Institute, some common barriers to implementing MBC include lack of knowledge to execute MBC, lack of clarity on the clinical utility, and the administrative burden.Here are a few of the other common barriers we hear from our partners at NeuroFlow:Particularly in a primary care setting, providers may only see their patients once a year. If that is the case, routine assessments may not be possible, and MBC will be far less effective.Many providers collect assessment data via paper questionnaires which they may or may not transfer to an EHR. Manual data collection makes centralizing and analyzing patient data much more difficult and time-consuming, limiting the positive impacts of MBC.Some patients may not feel comfortable sharing their behavioral health challenges in a doctor’s office, particularly a primary care office where they may not seek out behavioral health support. As a result, providers may collect inaccurate or biased data that doesn’t reflect the actual well-being of their patients.While MBC is a great tool for tracking patient progress and overall health, it may not be clear for some providers what level of care is most appropriate. In the primary care setting, providers may not have the resources or expertise to support a patient. Referring to a specialist is the norm, but many patients may never see that specialist or drop out of treatment all together.It’s time for measurement-based care in behavioral health to get an upgrade; fortunately, technology can solve some of the inefficient processes care providers navigate today. Delivering questionnaires digitally to a patient’s preferred device allows providers to measure patient progress regularly and collect more accurate data. Storing patient data on a centralized platform ensures providers never miss important changes in patients’ health. And finally, a robust digital behavioral health platform can analyze questionnaire scores, connecting patients with appropriate resources or, alternatively, refer them to a care manager for intervention.NeuroFlow’s solution helps providers achieve all of the above. We strive to simplify behavioral health care so that every patient receives the right level of care at the right time. Our platform works with providers to regularly engage their populations through our app. Often the first activities individuals receive on the app are rating scales like PHQ-9 or GAD-7. Depending on an individual’s responses, NeuroFlow will tailor behavioral health curriculum to support her specific needs. The platform delivers validated assessments regularly to track progress, and that data is stored centrally in our cloud-based patient registry which integrates directly with providers’ EHR.NeuroFlow also makes it easy to determine the level of care each patient requires. Using assessment data and other validated metrics, NeuroFlow creates a unique severity score, to develop a baseline for individuals and triage accordingly. Providers then receive alerts when a spike in severity scores occurs or patients are at risk and intervention is required.MBC in behavioral health doesn’t have to be complicated. With the right technology to deliver assessments, provide patient insights, and guide next steps, providers can better serve their populations and ensure no single patient falls through the cracks.Request a demo to see NeuroFlow in action!Terms of Service | BAA | Privacy Policy | CCPA | SubprocessorsCopyright © NeuroFlow. 2022.

NeuroFlow is committed to delivering evidence-based behavioral health support based on rigorous scientific research. Here are the latest studies inspiring and fueling our mission.Click to view studySummary: Findings from this study support use of a technology-enabled behavioral health tool to decrease emergency department use and highlight the importance of measurement-based care. Future research will be key to enhancing behavioral health technology and integration to further improve patient outcomes and reduce emergency department utilization.Stats at a glance:See related case studyClick to view studySummary: The use of measurement-based care in integrated care settings offers a means to address existing treatment gaps for individuals with mental health disorders seeking care. Findings from this study demonstrate the large-scale feasibility (n > 4,000) of remotely collecting mental health data via a mobile technology platform and that changes in depression and anxiety symptoms, including suicidal ideation, can be reliably assessed. Findings further revealed that digitally-enabled measurement-based care (MBC) supported patients experiencing moderate, moderately severe, or severe depression or anxiety in achieving clinically and statistically significant symptom improvements.Stats at a glance:See related research: Counselor and student perceptions of an mHealth technology platform used in a school counseling settingClick to view studySummary: The ability to risk stratify a patient population to inform population level interventions is key to efficient, high quality, measurement-based care. Current methodologies focus predominantly on validated assessments alone, without consideration of other qualitative measures of symptom impact on functionality. This study details the development of the NeuroFlow Severity Score (NFSS) and evaluates its utility for population level risk stratification when compared to the Personal Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) and Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7), and expert clinician review.  Based on over 35,000 NeuroFlow users, the NFSS demonstrates the simultaneous credibility and clinical validity of a comprehensive single risk index while reducing effort and burden for clinicians.Stats at a glance:Be sure to check this page regularly for our latest updates regarding our ongoing research efforts!Terms of Service | BAA | Privacy Policy | CCPA | SubprocessorsCopyright © NeuroFlow. 2022.

CoCM enables a holistic team-based approach to treating common mental health conditions by integrating behavioral health professionals into the care team, while simultaneously increasing the confidence and competence of physical health providers in treating these disorders.While the clinical effectiveness of CoCM in managing higher acuity patients is backed by years of research, it traditionally comes with high costs and a long ramp-up time. NeuroFlow’s solution for CoCM combines technology and services to drive results quickly and cost-effectively.Implementation and scaling of services is impeded by challenges in hiring  behavioral health care managers and psychiatric consultants.  Staffing is expensive and difficult due to provider shortages, training, and ramp up.Manual referral processes impede filling CoCM caseloads, causing behavioral teams to be underutilized and creating financial burden to the organization.Static tools like spreadsheets serve as the home for patient tracking and management, making collaboration difficult and scaling inefficient.Paper-and-pencil approach means PCPs are manually uploading assessment data to EHRs and reviewing treatment recommendations outside their usual systems.Staffing support with experienced behavioral health care managers and psychiatric consultants takes burden off your teams and allows for immediate implementation and scaling.App-based remote universal assessments rapidly identify CoCM-appropriate patients, and targeted bulk patient invitations fill your caseload from day one.Our cloud-based registry enables real-time collaboration and management of your patient panel with straightforward time-tracking and documentation, making scaling your CoCM program easier and more efficient.EHR integrations and comprehensive reporting keep PCPs informed within their existing workflows.increase in caseload capacityreduction in time to responsecare team satisfaction using NeuroFlow*NeuroFlow measures clinical and engagement outcome metrics as evidence for the efficacy of our solution, based on internal data (n>146,000)“The last thing I wanted to do was to have a patient in a waiting room fill out a screening tool, give it to someone at the front office, have them score it, enter it into the EHR, and then expect the PCP to see that before they go in and meet the patient…Now we are doing outreach to 30,000 people which helps us identify people who actually meet the criteria for treatment before they come into the office, which is ideal.”– John Eiler, System VP of Behavioral Services at Health FirstRead MoreCollaborative care is a model of integrated care that was developed at the University of Washington AIMS Center to treat mental health conditions like depression and anxiety which require regular follow-up due to their persistent nature. Collaborative care focuses on defined populations that are tracked within a registry and leverages a care team made up of primary care providers, behavioral health care managers, and psychiatric consultants, who provide evidence-based, brief interventions and prescribe medication when necessary.Over 90 randomized trials have proven collaborative care to be one of the most effective ways to treat diverse populations that have a variety of behavioral health and comorbid medical conditions, enhancing both mental and physical well-being.Collaborative care requires new workflows and team members. In a typical medical care scenario, the treatment team has two members, the primary care provider (PCP) and the patient. In collaborative care, there are two additional roles, the behavioral health care manager (BHCM) and the psychiatric consult. These additional care team members are critical for closing the gap between physical and mental health care, ensuring behavioral health conditions are not left untreated as is often the case in primary care settings.The primary care provider determines whether the patient should be enrolled in collaborative care based on behavioral health symptoms, medications needs, or the patient’s level of support. Treating behavioral health conditions in a primary care setting improves access for patients who already have an existing relationship with their PCP.The PCP then introduces the patient to the BHCM who will conduct regular, brief interventions with the patients. These interventions include conducting validated assessments like the PHQ-9 for depression or GAD-7 for anxiety as well evidence-based therapies like cognitive-based therapy (CBT).In addition to communicating with the PCP and patient regularly, the BHCM also works with a psychiatric consultant to determine prescription needs and adjust the care plan based on patient outcomes. The care manager and psychiatric consult collaborate through a patient registry to effectively manage the patient caseload and monitor the population. This workflow makes it easier to identify, treat, and monitor patients who have behavioral health conditions within a primary care setting and drives significantly improved outcomes. In the groundbreaking IMPACT Study, collaborative care doubled the effectiveness of depression treatment for older adults in the primary care setting.According to the University of Washington AIMS Center, there are five core components of the collaborative care model, and each element must be in place in order to deliver effective care to the patient population.The patient must be at the center of the care team to deliver high-quality collaborative care. Providing both physical and mental health care through a single care team is comfortable and convenient for the patient and improves engagement. Greater patient engagement leads to a better health care experience and improved patient outcomes.Collaborative care is delivered across a population to ensure no individual falls through the cracks. A patient registry enables care teams to track every patient in the population and identify when behavioral health conditions worsen and regular interventions are required.Also known as stepped care, measurement-based treatment to target means that patients have a specific goal or clinical outcome to reach through collaborative care, such as a score that’s 10 or lower on a PHQ-9 assessment. Treatment plans are measured against those results and change if a patient’s behavioral health is not improving.Collaborative care provides treatments that are backed by credible research, including evidence-based therapies like cognitive-based therapy (CBT) and problem-solving treatment (PST). The care manager delivers these therapies in the form of brief interventions, taking the burden of care off the PCP.Collaborative care can be billed through a fee-for-service arrangement using CPT codes. CoCM is also compatible with a value-based care billing model. In that arrangement, providers are reimbursed for the quality of care and clinical outcomes, not just the volume of care provided.CoCM programs are inherently patient-centric because they are proven to increase patient engagement by treating physical and behavioral health together. Providers empower patients to set goals for themselves and to make sure those goals are communicated to every member of the care team. For patients, goals should be about improving their lives—not just their diagnosis.Patients work directly with their behavioral health care managers to set their personal goals so that clear communication is formed at the onset of the program. The care manager discusses the patient’s desires with the psychiatric consultant who then uses this information to provide patient-focused recommendations to the medical provider.A patient-centric program should also provide behavioral health resources, such as digital health content, that patients can explore outside of a healthcare setting. Some collaborative care technology solutions offer patients tools to track their well-being or self-guided dCBT curricula. These collaborative care platforms provide diverse options for patients to manage their behavioral health in a way that works best for them.Implementing collaborative care requires significant upfront investment of time and resources to establish new workflows, train staff, and invest in the technology necessary to manage population-wide data. The right technology can streamline workflows and create the necessary connections between an EHR and the patient registry so that no patient is overlooked.Technology can also empower care teams to deliver assessments and treatment remotely to a much larger population and personalize care plans based on patient engagement and scores. For example, a digital collaborative care solution can quickly identify an individual’s depression symptoms, flag that patient in the registry for the care team, and immediately deliver customized depression content so that the patient receives timely support.After a patient completes collaborative care, behavioral health technology can continue to engage that patient with evidence-based content and monitor well-being over time. This is incredibly valuable if a patient relapses in between primary care visits. When a patient’s well-being declines, the primary care provider is alerted immediately, and the patient receives the appropriate level of care before symptoms worsen.Learn more about NeuroFlow’s high-tech and high-touch approach to collaborative care here.Request your demo today to see NeuroFlow in action!Terms of Service | BAA | Privacy Policy | CCPA | SubprocessorsCopyright © NeuroFlow. 2022.

Utilizing measurement-based care in behavioral health is a proven approach to improve outcomes, reduce costs, and enhance clinical workflowsMeasurement-based care (MBC) can be defined as the practice of basing clinical care on data collected throughout treatment. MBC is considered a core component of numerous evidence-based practices and frameworks that can be added to any treatment.Traditional physical health has measurement, and so should behavioral health.DiabetesTreatment: Insulin, Dietary Changes, Medication.Heart DiseaseTreatment: Medical Procedures, Exercise, Stress Management.Anxiety & DepressionTreatment: CBT, Integrated Care, Mindfulness, Medication.NeuroFlow derives insights from assessment results and other key data points to help you better understand your population and support their care journey. NeuroFlow’s engaging digital experience helps increase screening rates while delivering personalized and relevant content to meet individual needs.IdentifySurface behavioral health conditions proactively before they escalateTriageEmpower care teams with the best next steps for care based on a combination of data pointsManageEnhance care team productivity and collaboration with the data they need to best support patientsIn behavioral health, MBC is powered by validated rating scales which take the form of brief questionnaires. These are often administered to patients at intake and periodically throughout their treatment. Questionnaires allow clinicians to understand how a patient is progressing and whether there is remission in conditions like depression or anxiety.Rating scales typically screen for a specific behavioral health condition like anxiety or depression. Some common rating scales include:GAD-7 – Generalized Anxiety Disorder scalePHQ-9 – Patient Health Questionnaire, depression moduleWHO-5 – World Health Organization 5 Well-Being IndexAt NeuroFlow, we provide over 20 questionnaires, including those listed above. We also measure other forms of patient-generated data that inform well-being, like sleep and mood ratings. We’re constantly adding more assessment capabilities to our platform to improve insights for care providers and better engage the individuals who use our platform.Regular measurement of patients’ behavioral health means more timely interventions and better treatment. That leads to fewer behavioral health crises and improved well-being for patients. Specifically, MBC improves behavioral healthcare in the following ways:Having a standard, clinically-vetted rating scale translates certain subjective experiences into measurable data that care providers can act on. Not all behavioral health indicators can be quantified in this way, but establishing a baseline and having a standard frame of reference helps care providers more easily assess the severity of behavioral health conditions.With greater insight into patients’ behavioral health, care providers can offer more effective and personalized treatment and share insights across care teams. MBC insights can help determine medication dosage, intervention plans, or match patients with the right care provider.When MBC is done right, care providers regularly engage their patients which improves the quantity and quality of data collection. This can help providers deliver interventions earlier and provide more effective preventative care. It also means patients can receive the right resources and tools to drive improved self-care in between appointments.Despite the benefits, many care providers struggle to embrace MBC when managing the behavioral health of their populations. According to research from the Kaiser Permanente Washington Health Research Institute, some common barriers to implementing MBC include lack of knowledge to execute MBC, lack of clarity on the clinical utility, and the administrative burden.Here are a few of the other common barriers we hear from our partners at NeuroFlow:Particularly in a primary care setting, providers may only see their patients once a year. If that is the case, routine assessments may not be possible, and MBC will be far less effective.Many providers collect assessment data via paper questionnaires which they may or may not transfer to an EHR. Manual data collection makes centralizing and analyzing patient data much more difficult and time-consuming, limiting the positive impacts of MBC.Some patients may not feel comfortable sharing their behavioral health challenges in a doctor’s office, particularly a primary care office where they may not seek out behavioral health support. As a result, providers may collect inaccurate or biased data that doesn’t reflect the actual well-being of their patients.While MBC is a great tool for tracking patient progress and overall health, it may not be clear for some providers what level of care is most appropriate. In the primary care setting, providers may not have the resources or expertise to support a patient. Referring to a specialist is the norm, but many patients may never see that specialist or drop out of treatment all together.It’s time for measurement-based care in behavioral health to get an upgrade; fortunately, technology can solve some of the inefficient processes care providers navigate today. Delivering questionnaires digitally to a patient’s preferred device allows providers to measure patient progress regularly and collect more accurate data. Storing patient data on a centralized platform ensures providers never miss important changes in patients’ health. And finally, a robust digital behavioral health platform can analyze questionnaire scores, connecting patients with appropriate resources or, alternatively, refer them to a care manager for intervention.NeuroFlow’s solution helps providers achieve all of the above. We strive to simplify behavioral health care so that every patient receives the right level of care at the right time. Our platform works with providers to regularly engage their populations through our app. Often the first activities individuals receive on the app are rating scales like PHQ-9 or GAD-7. Depending on an individual’s responses, NeuroFlow will tailor behavioral health curriculum to support her specific needs. The platform delivers validated assessments regularly to track progress, and that data is stored centrally in our cloud-based patient registry which integrates directly with providers’ EHR.NeuroFlow also makes it easy to determine the level of care each patient requires. Using assessment data and other validated metrics, NeuroFlow creates a unique severity score, to develop a baseline for individuals and triage accordingly. Providers then receive alerts when a spike in severity scores occurs or patients are at risk and intervention is required.MBC in behavioral health doesn’t have to be complicated. With the right technology to deliver assessments, provide patient insights, and guide next steps, providers can better serve their populations and ensure no single patient falls through the cracks.Request a demo to see NeuroFlow in action!Terms of Service | BAA | Privacy Policy | CCPA | SubprocessorsCopyright © NeuroFlow. 2022.

NeuroFlow’s market-leading solution provides the technology and staffing to successfully implement sustainable collaborative care at scaleThe Psychiatric Collaborative Care Model (CoCM) is the most effective evidence-based integrated care model for behavioral health, validated by more than 90 randomized controlled trials. CoCM enables a holistic team-based approach to treating common mental health conditions by integrating behavioral health professionals into the care team, while simultaneously increasing the confidence and competence of physical health providers in treating these disorders.While the clinical effectiveness of CoCM in managing higher acuity patients is backed by years of research, it traditionally comes with high costs and a long ramp-up time. NeuroFlow’s solution for CoCM combines technology and services to drive results quickly and cost-effectively.Implementation and scaling of services is impeded by challenges in hiring  behavioral health care managers and psychiatric consultants.  Staffing is expensive and difficult due to provider shortages, training, and ramp up.Manual referral processes impede filling CoCM caseloads, causing behavioral teams to be underutilized and creating financial burden to the organization.Static tools like spreadsheets serve as the home for patient tracking and management, making collaboration difficult and scaling inefficient.Paper-and-pencil approach means PCPs are manually uploading assessment data to EHRs and reviewing treatment recommendations outside their usual systems.Staffing support with experienced behavioral health care managers and psychiatric consultants takes burden off your teams and allows for immediate implementation and scaling.App-based remote universal assessments rapidly identify CoCM-appropriate patients, and targeted bulk patient invitations fill your caseload from day one.Our cloud-based registry enables real-time collaboration and management of your patient panel with straightforward time-tracking and documentation, making scaling your CoCM program easier and more efficient.EHR integrations and comprehensive reporting keep PCPs informed within their existing workflows.increase in caseload capacityreduction in time to responsecare team satisfaction using NeuroFlow*NeuroFlow measures clinical and engagement outcome metrics as evidence for the efficacy of our solution, based on internal data (n>146,000)“The last thing I wanted to do was to have a patient in a waiting room fill out a screening tool, give it to someone at the front office, have them score it, enter it into the EHR, and then expect the PCP to see that before they go in and meet the patient…Now we are doing outreach to 30,000 people which helps us identify people who actually meet the criteria for treatment before they come into the office, which is ideal.”– John Eiler, System VP of Behavioral Services at Health FirstRead MoreCollaborative care is a model of integrated care that was developed at the University of Washington AIMS Center to treat mental health conditions like depression and anxiety which require regular follow-up due to their persistent nature. Collaborative care focuses on defined populations that are tracked within a registry and leverages a care team made up of primary care providers, behavioral health care managers, and psychiatric consultants, who provide evidence-based, brief interventions and prescribe medication when necessary.Over 90 randomized trials have proven collaborative care to be one of the most effective ways to treat diverse populations that have a variety of behavioral health and comorbid medical conditions, enhancing both mental and physical well-being.Collaborative care requires new workflows and team members. In a typical medical care scenario, the treatment team has two members, the primary care provider (PCP) and the patient. In collaborative care, there are two additional roles, the behavioral health care manager (BHCM) and the psychiatric consult. These additional care team members are critical for closing the gap between physical and mental health care, ensuring behavioral health conditions are not left untreated as is often the case in primary care settings.The primary care provider determines whether the patient should be enrolled in collaborative care based on behavioral health symptoms, medications needs, or the patient’s level of support. Treating behavioral health conditions in a primary care setting improves access for patients who already have an existing relationship with their PCP.The PCP then introduces the patient to the BHCM who will conduct regular, brief interventions with the patients. These interventions include conducting validated assessments like the PHQ-9 for depression or GAD-7 for anxiety as well evidence-based therapies like cognitive-based therapy (CBT).In addition to communicating with the PCP and patient regularly, the BHCM also works with a psychiatric consultant to determine prescription needs and adjust the care plan based on patient outcomes. The care manager and psychiatric consult collaborate through a patient registry to effectively manage the patient caseload and monitor the population. This workflow makes it easier to identify, treat, and monitor patients who have behavioral health conditions within a primary care setting and drives significantly improved outcomes. In the groundbreaking IMPACT Study, collaborative care doubled the effectiveness of depression treatment for older adults in the primary care setting.According to the University of Washington AIMS Center, there are five core components of the collaborative care model, and each element must be in place in order to deliver effective care to the patient population.The patient must be at the center of the care team to deliver high-quality collaborative care. Providing both physical and mental health care through a single care team is comfortable and convenient for the patient and improves engagement. Greater patient engagement leads to a better health care experience and improved patient outcomes.Collaborative care is delivered across a population to ensure no individual falls through the cracks. A patient registry enables care teams to track every patient in the population and identify when behavioral health conditions worsen and regular interventions are required.Also known as stepped care, measurement-based treatment to target means that patients have a specific goal or clinical outcome to reach through collaborative care, such as a score that’s 10 or lower on a PHQ-9 assessment. Treatment plans are measured against those results and change if a patient’s behavioral health is not improving.Collaborative care provides treatments that are backed by credible research, including evidence-based therapies like cognitive-based therapy (CBT) and problem-solving treatment (PST). The care manager delivers these therapies in the form of brief interventions, taking the burden of care off the PCP.Collaborative care can be billed through a fee-for-service arrangement using CPT codes. CoCM is also compatible with a value-based care billing model. In that arrangement, providers are reimbursed for the quality of care and clinical outcomes, not just the volume of care provided.CoCM programs are inherently patient-centric because they are proven to increase patient engagement by treating physical and behavioral health together. Providers empower patients to set goals for themselves and to make sure those goals are communicated to every member of the care team. For patients, goals should be about improving their lives—not just their diagnosis.Patients work directly with their behavioral health care managers to set their personal goals so that clear communication is formed at the onset of the program. The care manager discusses the patient’s desires with the psychiatric consultant who then uses this information to provide patient-focused recommendations to the medical provider.A patient-centric program should also provide behavioral health resources, such as digital health content, that patients can explore outside of a healthcare setting. Some collaborative care technology solutions offer patients tools to track their well-being or self-guided dCBT curricula. These collaborative care platforms provide diverse options for patients to manage their behavioral health in a way that works best for them.Implementing collaborative care requires significant upfront investment of time and resources to establish new workflows, train staff, and invest in the technology necessary to manage population-wide data. The right technology can streamline workflows and create the necessary connections between an EHR and the patient registry so that no patient is overlooked.Technology can also empower care teams to deliver assessments and treatment remotely to a much larger population and personalize care plans based on patient engagement and scores. For example, a digital collaborative care solution can quickly identify an individual’s depression symptoms, flag that patient in the registry for the care team, and immediately deliver customized depression content so that the patient receives timely support.After a patient completes collaborative care, behavioral health technology can continue to engage that patient with evidence-based content and monitor well-being over time. This is incredibly valuable if a patient relapses in between primary care visits. When a patient’s well-being declines, the primary care provider is alerted immediately, and the patient receives the appropriate level of care before symptoms worsen.Learn more about NeuroFlow’s high-tech and high-touch approach to collaborative care here.Request your demo today to see NeuroFlow in action!Terms of Service | BAA | Privacy Policy | CCPA | SubprocessorsCopyright © NeuroFlow. 2022.

Many of us are now familiar with the “digital front door” concept which came out of a desire to increase access to traditional care through advancements in technology—making it easier to schedule appointments, find a doctor, or review personal medical records. The digital front door was an important first step in using technology to increase access; however, it’s just the beginning.

Today, technology can extend an organization’s ability to identify needs, triage, and even deliver care with efficacy and scale that increases access, improves outcomes, and reduces the burden on staff. Paired with the growing understanding of how closely mental and physical health are linked, technology is creating new opportunities for providers to deliver care differently to their community in ways that add more value and frequency to patient interactions.

While there is massive potential, aligning diverse technology solutions to effectively serve the needs of a population is challenging. That’s why NeuroFlow is setting a “new standard of digital care,” a high-tech, high-touch approach to behavioral health that we believe health systems should and can incorporate. This standard of digital care creates a behavioral health infrastructure across enterprise health systems, enabling care teams to serve populations with varying and evolving needs in a unified way.The New Standard of Digital Care for behavioral health is simply this:In this blog, we’ll explore how each of these core functions enables comprehensive behavioral health at the population level, and support other critical population needs like identifying and addressing SDOH and managing comorbidities.Behavioral health is inextricably linked to population health, but most health systems struggle to identify and support the behavioral health needs of their populations. Behavioral health typically remains siloed in a department that is understaffed and overloaded with demand, while scores of patients remain on lengthy wait lists, don’t follow through on referrals, or are never properly identified as needing behavioral health support at all.Technology plays a pivotal role in scaling behavioral health measurement and support population-wide, but to date a lack of consistent, principled approach to digital care has made it difficult to know where to start. The standard of digital care aims to resolve these persistent issues that have prevented behavioral health technologies from making the greatest impact on population well-being.Before health systems can provide behavioral health support, they need a way to identify unaddressed needs, risk stratify their population, and identify the appropriate level of care. NeuroFlow accomplishes this by delivering regular behavioral health assessments via app when an individual begins using NeuroFlow and throughout their journey. Assessments include clinically-validated questionnaires like the PHQ-9, GAD-7, and WHO-5. These initial assessments achieve a 65% completion rate on NeuroFlow, creating a much clearer picture of population health. Plus, patients’ ability to take assessments on their own time, in the comfort of their home, is believed to improve response candor.NeuroFlow’s measurement-based care approach provides longitudinal data that alerts care teams when a patient’s wellness is trending downward and an intervention may be needed. NeuroFlow’s proprietary Severity Score takes into account assessment scores and other user-reported data to generate a unique risk baseline for each patient, which enables detection of worsening conditions and prompts action by care teams when necessary. Changes to Severity Score are monitored over time in NeuroFlow’s Manage platform, helping care teams identify and prioritize who may need support on an ongoing basis.A critical way to meet the diverse needs of a population is to empower individuals with evidenced-based behavioral health resources that they can discover at their own pace. Built on the tenets of digital cognitive behavioral therapy (dCBT), NeuroFlow provides a wide range of dCBT curricula, known as journeys, on topics like worry and tension, substance use, healthy relationships, parenting wellness, and more. Individuals have 24/7 access to journeys, and can explore the topics that interest them most in our Journey Gallery.

The platform also assigns relevant content to individuals based on changes to Severity Score. A notable increase in severity levels would not only trigger an at-risk alert to care teams, but would also assign the patient a depression journey, for example, to receive self-guided support.Engagement is a critical part of NeuroFlow’s standard of digital care. Using a mixture of gamification, reminders, and notifications, NeuroFlow has achieved industry-leading engagement rates. After one month, 57% of registered patients remain active on the platform, compared to the industry standard of 6%. At the six month mark, 33% of these patients are still completing at least one activity per day on average.Access to behavioral health specialists remains a huge barrier to improved population health. 45% of the U.S. population lives in an area with a shortage of mental health professionals, and 70% of all psychiatrists are 50 and older which will result in an even greater shortage as they retire. Teletherapy and telepsychiatry can help alleviate this burden, which is why NeuroFlow is excited to partner with four of the leading behavioral health organizations in the country: Array, LifeStance Health, Marvin, and Brightside Health. With these partnerships, NeuroFlow can leverage its Severity Score-powered triage engine to guide the right individuals to the right higher level of care when appropriate, either directly through the app or through care coordination.

Referrals can also be customized by population. If post-traumatic stress, for example, is prevalent within a population, NeuroFlow can prioritize therapists who specialize in PTSD. Alternatively, the app can refer only to therapists that take an individual’s insurance. This level of versatility helps NeuroFlow adapt to the unique needs of a health system and its population.Suicide is a leading cause of death in U.S., claiming over 49,000 lives in 2020. Tragically, 45% of individuals who took their own life had contact with primary care providers within one month of suicide. That is why suicide prevention is an essential part of a comprehensive behavioral health solution for populations. NeuroFlow offers Response Services, a network of certified mental health professionals who proactively contact individuals when they trigger an at-risk or urgent alert. These alerts could be triggered by a recent assessment or through natural language processing technology which analyzes and flags free text shared in the NeuroFlow app that indicates self harm or suicidal ideation. The combination of identification through technology and high-touch, compassionate care provided by our response services coordinators makes a significant impact on suicide prevention.“We actually had a woman who had been treated by doctors for years for a chronic illness, but had never been able to disclose that she’d had suicidal thoughts for years,” says Faith Best, NeuroFlow’s Clinical Services Senior Manager, “So using the app gave her the opportunity to identify that, and then NeuroFlow was able to respond, and we got her connected to therapy, which was huge for her. She actually said, ‘This might be a small thing for you, but it’s a big thing for me.’”Partnering with CAMS-Care, an organization that provides suicide prevention training and resources, NeuroFlow incorporates an industry-leading suicide prevention protocol into our platform. We provide valuable assessment tools to care teams along with population monitoring and proactive crisis outreach. In addition, NeuroFlow offers easily accessible crisis resources, including the new mental health and suicide prevention lifeline, 988, which patients can contact directly through the app. With Response Services, NeuroFlow is able to intervene before individuals reach crisis and refer them to the appropriate level of care.A unified, holistic approach to behavioral health will make the greatest impact on population well-being. We’ve seen this time and time again at NeuroFlow. The more that health systems can engage, monitor, and proactively respond to their populations’ needs, the better they will be able to elevate and standardize quality of care across the population. A high-touch, high-tech approach can eliminate inconsistent behavioral health approaches across different sites and ensure high-quality care. According to the American Medical Association, the benefits of high-touch and high-tech behavioral health care include improved outcomes, greater access to care, lower costs, and improved provider satisfaction.

Jim Feen, senior vice president and chief digital and information officer at Southcoast Health SystemPhoto: Jim FeenSouthcoast Health System, based in New Bedford, Massachusetts, has employed a multipronged approach to solving different issues through telemedicine.THE PROBLEMWhile early goals involved keeping care accessible and safe during the pandemic, staff have worked to focus on continuous improvement and adding programs that would build for long-term value in care delivery."One of the first telemedicine solutions we utilized involved tele-triage to reduce PPE demands in our emergency departments and ensure patients were directed to the appropriate level of care," recalled Jim Feen, senior vice president and chief digital and information officer at Southcoast Health System. "Patients seen this way showed a variety of symptoms and this method helped decide which cases may be more appropriate for an urgent care setting or perhaps even a referral back to primary care."There were automations built within our existing Microsoft Teams platform that allowed for seamless tele-triage screenings to be initiated by triage nurses in our ED," he continued. "We have other use-case scenarios."PROPOSALMore innovative use cases involved looking at the increasing demands for psychiatric/behavioral health services up against increasingly taxed provider resources. These fluctuations and increases in needs for behavioral health services both at the peak of the pandemic and to date are well documented nationally. The Southcoast region has been no exception to these challenges."Both the selection and upcoming implementation of the Neuroflow platform at Southcoast Health is a strategic effort to leverage digital technology to help our behavioral health providers and staff remotely manage the growing and currently underserved behavioral health needs across Southcoast patients," Feen explained."We view Neuroflow as an enabling technology to risk stratify patients in real time who need care interventions based on patient interaction with various assessments that are offered within this platform," he continued.Starting this fall, the platform will enable the behavioral health providers and staff to remotely identify and take targeted action to avoid behavioral health crises before they happen through Neuroflow's digital feedback loop and intervention support tools, he added."Our primary goal with this tool is enabling broader surveillance with patients using the technology to remotely identify patients who need targeted behavioral care in the moment, without requiring traditional face-to-face visits and/or telehealth visits if determined clinically appropriate by the patient's care team," Feen said."While the goal is to manage more patients remotely by targeting patients with highest risk factors who need intervention the most, a secondary goal of the tool is to avoid unnecessary ED visits and/or acute care for patients who are successfully managed before the onset of an acute event," he added.In an entirely different space, a building block toward the health system's hospital-at-home effort is its remote patient monitoring capability with colleagues in the Southcoast Visiting Nurse Association."While hospital-at-home is not a formalized program at Southcoast quite yet, we leveraged an FCC telehealth grant to expand remote patient monitoring devices including tablets with integrated stethoscopes, blood pressure monitors and pulse oximeters to expand telemedicine capabilities of our VNA," Feen said."These devices are used to target patients with certain chronic diseases such as CHF or COPD and allow for interventions to occur when risk factors are observed by a team of VNA nurses who analyze trends for each patient captured through the RPM," he added.MARKETPLACEThere are many vendors of telemedicine technology and services on the health IT market today. Healthcare IT News published a special report highlighting many of these vendors with detailed descriptions of their products. Click here to read the special report.MEETING THE CHALLENGESince Southcoast Health System's telehealth efforts have a number of different use cases, many roles are involved."A key learning for us in our journey over the last 28 months that will carry into the future is there is no 'easy button' or one-size-fits-all approach when it comes to successfully implementing or integrating a telehealth solution into the care delivery approach," Feen said."For Teams, while tele-triage is a stand-alone feature to streamline the triage and telehealth process for our ED groups, it became acceptable to simplify a solution to keep it highly efficient and not have the process integrated within our Epic EHR system," Feen noted."Yet that same approach would be very different when considering the integration needs of a Neuroflow or RPM use case, which has much deeper clinical integration needs for the staff who are trying to manage complex populations through the tools," he continued. "Verifying workflow assumptions and requirements is key, and getting staff involved early who are 'at the controls' in these care delivery processes is an absolute must-do."RESULTSFor Southcoast patients who use the remote patient monitoring services, staff have achieved a hospital readmission rate that is 50% lower than the other patients on VNA services. For patients with CHF or COPD who would typically have a hospital readmission rate of 20%, this rate falls to 5% to 10% for those patients covered by RPM services."In May of this year alone, we had 175 patients on RPM and the readmission rate back to the hospital was down to 5%," said Patty Buiocchi, senior vice president of the Southcoast Health Visiting Nurse Association and Health-At-Home.USING FCC AWARD FUNDSSouthcoast Health System was awarded an FCC telehealth program grant of $1 million for laptops, mobile devices and remote patient monitoring equipment to expand the hospital's telehealth capabilities and provide quality care services to patients at home."Our hope is the FCC award funds will help us solidify the foundation of telehealth at Southcoast making care more accessible and efficient for our community," Feen said. "These advancements will allow us to provide more timely and accessible care and over the longer term help achieve goals toward lowering total cost of care by reducing unnecessary ED visits or acute admissions/readmissions."It also will help with balancing provider utilization in the face of extreme patient demand and resource constraint in the case of the behavioral health services use case," he concluded.Twitter: @SiwickiHealthIT

Here are the latest studies inspiring and fueling our mission.Click to view studySummary: Findings from this study support use of a technology-enabled behavioral health tool to decrease emergency department use and highlight the importance of measurement-based care. Future research will be key to enhancing behavioral health technology and integration to further improve patient outcomes and reduce emergency department utilization.Stats at a glance:See related case studyClick to view studySummary: The use of measurement-based care in integrated care settings offers a means to address existing treatment gaps for individuals with mental health disorders seeking care. Findings from this study demonstrate the large-scale feasibility (n > 4,000) of remotely collecting mental health data via a mobile technology platform and that changes in depression and anxiety symptoms, including suicidal ideation, can be reliably assessed. Findings further revealed that digitally-enabled measurement-based care (MBC) supported patients experiencing moderate, moderately severe, or severe depression or anxiety in achieving clinically and statistically significant symptom improvements.Stats at a glance:See related research: Counselor and student perceptions of an mHealth technology platform used in a school counseling settingClick to view studySummary: The ability to risk stratify a patient population to inform population level interventions is key to efficient, high quality, measurement-based care. Current methodologies focus predominantly on validated assessments alone, without consideration of other qualitative measures of symptom impact on functionality. This study details the development of the NeuroFlow Severity Score (NFSS) and evaluates its utility for population level risk stratification when compared to the Personal Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) and Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7), and expert clinician review.  Based on over 35,000 NeuroFlow users, the NFSS demonstrates the simultaneous credibility and clinical validity of a comprehensive single risk index while reducing effort and burden for clinicians.Stats at a glance:Be sure to check this page regularly for our latest updates regarding our ongoing research efforts!Terms of Service | BAA | Privacy Policy | CCPA | SubprocessorsCopyright © NeuroFlow. 2022.

Utilizing measurement-based care in behavioral health is a proven approach to improve outcomes, reduce costs, and enhance clinical workflowsMeasurement-based care (MBC) can be defined as the practice of basing clinical care on data collected throughout treatment. MBC is considered a core component of numerous evidence-based practices and frameworks that can be added to any treatment.Traditional physical health has measurement, and so should behavioral health.DiabetesTreatment: Insulin, Dietary Changes, Medication.Heart DiseaseTreatment: Medical Procedures, Exercise, Stress Management.Anxiety & DepressionTreatment: CBT, Integrated Care, Mindfulness, Medication.NeuroFlow derives insights from assessment results and other key data points to help you better understand your population and support their care journey. NeuroFlow’s engaging digital experience helps increase screening rates while delivering personalized and relevant content to meet individual needs.IdentifySurface behavioral health conditions proactively before they escalateTriageEmpower care teams with the best next steps for care based on a combination of data pointsManageEnhance care team productivity and collaboration with the data they need to best support patientsIn behavioral health, MBC is powered by validated rating scales which take the form of brief questionnaires. These are often administered to patients at intake and periodically throughout their treatment. Questionnaires allow clinicians to understand how a patient is progressing and whether there is remission in conditions like depression or anxiety.Rating scales typically screen for a specific behavioral health condition like anxiety or depression. Some common rating scales include:GAD-7 – Generalized Anxiety Disorder scalePHQ-9 – Patient Health Questionnaire, depression moduleWHO-5 – World Health Organization 5 Well-Being IndexAt NeuroFlow, we provide over 20 questionnaires, including those listed above. We also measure other forms of patient-generated data that inform well-being, like sleep and mood ratings. We’re constantly adding more assessment capabilities to our platform to improve insights for care providers and better engage the individuals who use our platform.Regular measurement of patients’ behavioral health means more timely interventions and better treatment. That leads to fewer behavioral health crises and improved well-being for patients. Specifically, MBC improves behavioral healthcare in the following ways:Having a standard, clinically-vetted rating scale translates certain subjective experiences into measurable data that care providers can act on. Not all behavioral health indicators can be quantified in this way, but establishing a baseline and having a standard frame of reference helps care providers more easily assess the severity of behavioral health conditions.With greater insight into patients’ behavioral health, care providers can offer more effective and personalized treatment and share insights across care teams. MBC insights can help determine medication dosage, intervention plans, or match patients with the right care provider.When MBC is done right, care providers regularly engage their patients which improves the quantity and quality of data collection. This can help providers deliver interventions earlier and provide more effective preventative care. It also means patients can receive the right resources and tools to drive improved self-care in between appointments.Despite the benefits, many care providers struggle to embrace MBC when managing the behavioral health of their populations. According to research from the Kaiser Permanente Washington Health Research Institute, some common barriers to implementing MBC include lack of knowledge to execute MBC, lack of clarity on the clinical utility, and the administrative burden.Here are a few of the other common barriers we hear from our partners at NeuroFlow:Particularly in a primary care setting, providers may only see their patients once a year. If that is the case, routine assessments may not be possible, and MBC will be far less effective.Many providers collect assessment data via paper questionnaires which they may or may not transfer to an EHR. Manual data collection makes centralizing and analyzing patient data much more difficult and time-consuming, limiting the positive impacts of MBC.Some patients may not feel comfortable sharing their behavioral health challenges in a doctor’s office, particularly a primary care office where they may not seek out behavioral health support. As a result, providers may collect inaccurate or biased data that doesn’t reflect the actual well-being of their patients.While MBC is a great tool for tracking patient progress and overall health, it may not be clear for some providers what level of care is most appropriate. In the primary care setting, providers may not have the resources or expertise to support a patient. Referring to a specialist is the norm, but many patients may never see that specialist or drop out of treatment all together.It’s time for measurement-based care in behavioral health to get an upgrade; fortunately, technology can solve some of the inefficient processes care providers navigate today. Delivering questionnaires digitally to a patient’s preferred device allows providers to measure patient progress regularly and collect more accurate data. Storing patient data on a centralized platform ensures providers never miss important changes in patients’ health. And finally, a robust digital behavioral health platform can analyze questionnaire scores, connecting patients with appropriate resources or, alternatively, refer them to a care manager for intervention.NeuroFlow’s solution helps providers achieve all of the above. We strive to simplify behavioral health care so that every patient receives the right level of care at the right time. Our platform works with providers to regularly engage their populations through our app. Often the first activities individuals receive on the app are rating scales like PHQ-9 or GAD-7. Depending on an individual’s responses, NeuroFlow will tailor behavioral health curriculum to support her specific needs. The platform delivers validated assessments regularly to track progress, and that data is stored centrally in our cloud-based patient registry which integrates directly with providers’ EHR.NeuroFlow also makes it easy to determine the level of care each patient requires. Using assessment data and other validated metrics, NeuroFlow creates a unique severity score, to develop a baseline for individuals and triage accordingly. Providers then receive alerts when a spike in severity scores occurs or patients are at risk and intervention is required.MBC in behavioral health doesn’t have to be complicated. With the right technology to deliver assessments, provide patient insights, and guide next steps, providers can better serve their populations and ensure no single patient falls through the cracks.Request a demo to see NeuroFlow in action!Terms of Service | BAA | Privacy Policy | CCPA | SubprocessorsCopyright © NeuroFlow. 2022.
