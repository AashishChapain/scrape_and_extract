Woebot is a mental health app that is available on your schedule, at a moment’s notice, to help you work through the ups and downs of life.Please note: Our North Star has always been to make mental health radically accessible. That remains our mission today. We have found that people have the best experience when Woebot is delivered within a formal healthcare setting. Therefore, we believe we will have the most impact, and will reach more people in need, by partnering with health plans and health systems to make Woebot available to the people they serve. We’re starting in the United States with an eye to expand quickly after that.For that reason, Woebot is no longer currently available to people outside of the United States. If you need immediate assistance with your mental health, we recommend you search for local resources such as counseling services, hotlines or other mental health services available in your area.Like a lot of people, Maria was struggling with anxiety during the pandemic. After trying out several different forms of therapy, she started making real progress with Woebot.“I spiral with ‘You’re not good enough.’ Woebot had me rewrite the thought, and one day I rewrote it as ‘I am human.’ That has been such a freeing thought change. I’m allowed to be messy, and that’s okay.”Sophie Pierce, Eugene OR“This is so much more than an app. It has helped me through the hardest year I’ve ever experienced, and I’m genuinely a happier, more capable person because of that help.”Woebot user“Woebot is an excellent guide and the most knowledgeable friend. The one who is only one click away and takes me out of my distress in seconds.

Although digital tools may help mitigate this issue, critics have suggested that technological solutions that lack human empathy will prevent a bond or therapeutic alliance from being formed, thereby narrowing these solutions’ efficacy.Objective: We aimed to investigate whether users of a cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT)–based conversational agent would report therapeutic bond levels that are similar to those in literature about other CBT modalities, including face-to-face therapy, group CBT, and other digital interventions that do not use a conversational agent.Methods: A cross-sectional, retrospective study design was used to analyze aggregate, deidentified data from adult users who self-referred to a CBT-based, fully automated conversational agent (Woebot) between November 2019 and August 2020. Working alliance was measured with the Working Alliance Inventory-Short Revised (WAI-SR), and depression symptom status was assessed by using the 2-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-2). All measures were administered by the conversational agent in the mobile app. WAI-SR scores were compared to those in scientific literature abstracted from recent reviews.Results: Data from 36,070 Woebot users were included in the analysis. Participants ranged in age from 18 to 78 years, and 57.48% (20,734/36,070) of participants reported that they were female. The mean PHQ-2 score was 3.03 (SD 1.79), and 54.67% (19,719/36,070) of users scored over the cutoff score of 3 for depression screening. Within 5 days of initial app use, the mean WAI-SR score was 3.36 (SD 0.8) and the mean bond subscale score was 3.8 (SD 1.0), which was comparable to those in recent studies from the literature on traditional, outpatient, individual CBT and group CBT (mean bond subscale scores of 4 and 3.8, respectively). PHQ-2 scores at baseline weakly correlated with bond scores (r=−0.04; P<.001); however, users with depression and those without depression had high bond scores of 3.45.Conclusions: Although bonds are often presumed to be the exclusive domain of human therapeutic relationships, our findings challenge the notion that digital therapeutics are incapable of establishing a therapeutic bond with users. Future research might investigate the role of bonds as mediators of clinical outcomes, since boosting the engagement and efficacy of digital therapeutics could have major public health benefits.Significant barriers to mental health care are persistent [1]. The increased burden of depression and anxiety, which arose during the COVID-19 pandemic, has exacerbated this issue [2], as the measures that were put in place to stop the spread of SARS-CoV-2 have also presented unintended barriers to those seeking mental health treatment. One potentially viable solution is using digital mental health interventions to provide evidence-based treatment, such as cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). Self-directed mental health interventions, such as bibliotherapy, have long demonstrated their efficacy [3], and new models of blended care that combine internet-delivered interventions with human clinical oversight are becoming more widespread in a number of countries [4]. Although the implicit assumption has been that the involvement of a human leads to improved outcomes in self-directed programs, human involvement limits these programs’ scalability and limits their accessibility for those who live in remote locations [4]. If digital interventions could replicate some of the factors that are generally believed to be uniquely human, such as therapeutic rapport, these interventions would have greater potential for improving mental health.Recently, carefully designed conversational agents (CAs) have been showing promise in automating several health care services [5] by simulating human support. CAs could therefore be uniquely poised to offer high-quality digital interventions for mental health.An unblinded trial of one such CA (Woebot), which delivered CBT for symptoms of depression and anxiety, suggested that the empathic and relational nature of the tool may have fostered improved engagement better than previous internet-delivered versions of the tool [6]. Intriguingly, the study’s qualitative data suggested that users seemed to relate to the CA in a manner that was analogous to therapeutic rapport, which may have mediated users’ outcomes. For example, study participants reported that they felt cared for by the CA (eg, “Woebot felt like a real person that showed concern”), despite the fact that the tool’s scripts reminded users that Woebot is not a real person (Figure 1). Unfortunately however, the study did not formally assess the existence of a working alliance. This is a crucial factor because a strong working alliance between therapists and clients is considered to be predictive of positive outcomes, essential for the delivery of health care, and traditionally unique to the domain of human-to-human relationships. Indeed, some experts have argued that digital apps that are built to be standalone therapeutics have the risk of ignoring the potency of therapeutic relationships [7].Priority-setting work by the James Lind Alliance, which involves over 600 people affected by mental health concerns, has identified the greater understanding of digital therapeutic alliance as a top priority for research [8]. Yet, a recent review of mobile mental health apps failed to find a single study that included working alliance as a primary outcome [9]. Therefore, we sought to bridge this gap in knowledge by seeking to understand whether CA users perceived a working alliance, particularly the notion of bonds, and whether working alliance was related to symptom severity or other demographic characteristics.Woebot is a CA that guides individuals who experience symptoms of depression and anxiety through a smartphone-based app program that uses therapeutic techniques and provides psychoeducation. As previously described in detail [6], Woebot delivers CBT through brief, daily conversations (approximately 5-10 minutes each). Each simulated conversation begins with a mood-monitoring exercise, and the provided targeted content is responsive to individuals’ reported mood states. The CA is also programmed to deliver empathic statements and personalized follow-ups, promote normalization, and use methods that are designed to enhance users’ motivation for engaging in the program to promote desired behavior changes and help with mood management.During registration, users confirmed that they were at least 18 years of age and consented to the use of their deidentified, aggregate data for research. This study was not considered human subjects research by the Advarra institutional review board. Eligible participants included those who registered over two periods—between November 20, 2019, and April 9, 2020 (n=100,009), and again between July 8, 2020, and August 18, 2020 (n=77,203).Within 3-5 days after registration, eligible participants were invited to complete the 2-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-2) depression screener [10] and the Working Alliance Inventory-Short Revised (WAI-SR), which consists of a total score and the three following subscales: bond, goal, and task [11]. All measures and demographic information, including gender and age group, were gathered in the app by the CA. The WAI-SR was administered via the app’s conversational interface, in which the word “therapist” was changed to “Woebot” (Table 1). Once the questionnaires were completed, Woebot thanked registrants for their participation, and the conversation proceeded to the mood tracking phase as normal. Those who chose not to provide responses to the questionnaires were not included in this study and proceeded to use the app as normal.Across all eligible participants, the composite WAI-SR score and bond, goal, and task subscores were characterized based on descriptive statistics and tested for internal consistency by using the Cronbach α. The relationship between baseline PHQ-2 scores and bond subscores was characterized based on the Spearman rank-order correlation coefficient. The Kruskal-Wallis test was used to compare bond subscores across participants’ reported age groups and genders. For comparison, relevant external studies were drawn from recent reviews of literature [11-19] that also reported unmodified WAI-SR subscores for other CBT modalities. Comparison data were presented descriptively without statistical testing, and raw subscores were scaled by dividing them by the number of items (eg, the bond subscale has 4 items). Per the methods of Jasper et al [13], bond scores of ≥3.45 were considered high. The 95% CIs for mean WAI-SR subscores were calculated based on the published sample sizes and SDs. External studies were categorized as “online only” or “human involvement” based on whether any human interactions were reported by study participants during either individual therapy or group therapy that involved a human. Data were presented from participants who completed all questionnaires within the first 5 days of app registration. Data were analyzed using R version 4.0.2 (The R Foundation).AD, DS, and AR have full access to all of the data in this study and take responsibility for the integrity of the data and the accuracy of the data analysis. Due to their proprietary nature, data from this study will not be shared.Of the 177,212 eligible participants, only those who provided both WAI-SR and PHQ-2 data within 5 days of their first use of Woebot were included in the analysis. The final sample included 36,070 participants. Of these participants, 57.48% (n=20,734) reported that they were female, 25.17% (n=9078) reported that they were male; 2.87% (n=1035) reported that they were nonbinary, 1.44% (n=519) indicated another gender identity, 1.66% (n=597) preferred not to answer, and 11.39% (4107/36,070) did not provide any gender information. The participants ranged in age from 18 to 78 years (median 25-35 years). The mean PHQ-2 score was 3.03 (SD 1.79), and 54.67% (19,719/36,070) of participants scored at or above the conventional cutoff score of 3 for positively screening for depression.Within the first 5 days of using Woebot, the mean WAI-SR scores were as follows: a mean bond subscore of 3.84 (SD 1.0), a mean goal subscore of 3.25 (SD 1.0), a mean task subscore of 2.99 (SD 0.87), and a mean total score of 3.36 (SD 0.81). The WAI-SR had a Cronbach α value of .89, suggesting that the WAI-SR had adequate internal consistency in this study. A weak negative correlation was found between bond subscores and PHQ-2 scores (r=−0.04; P<.001); however, even among participants who reported the highest PHQ-2 score (PHQ-2=6), the mean WAI-SR bond subscore was 3.78. Bond subscores also differed by gender (P<.001) and by age group (P<.001); however, the mean bond scores for all groups were considered high (bond subscore>3.45) [13] Among these groups, the highest bond level was reported by women (bond subscore: mean 3.92) and by those aged 18-25 years (bond subscore: mean 3.96). Conversely, the lowest bond level was reported by individuals who indicated that they “preferred not to answer” or did not report their gender (bond subscore: mean 3.67) or age (bond subscore: mean 3.69).Woebot’s bond subscale scores were consistent with those of recent studies from the literature on traditional modalities for CBT delivery (Table 1). These studies’ results were collected later in the course of treatment (eg, bond subscore for face-to-face outpatient individual CBT: mean 4.0, SD 0.8 [11]; bond subscore for group CBT: mean 3.8, SD 0.80 [13]; data were collected after 2-8 weeks of therapy). Comparative study details are provided in Multimedia Appendix 1 [11,13-15,17-19]. Participants reported higher bond levels when using Woebot than those in prior studies of internet-only CBT [13] (Figure 2).This is the first study of working alliance among users of a CA for mental health. Most users were female (20,734/36,070, 57.48%) and had PHQ-2 scores that were indicative of depression (19,719/36,070, 54.67%). Working alliance scores were comparable to those in previously published studies on traditional, human-delivered services across different treatment modalities. Working alliance scores were highest for the bond subscale, suggesting that this subscale is a viable construct for CAs and should be included in hypothesized frameworks of digital working alliance.The idea that CAs can establish a working alliance is not new [20]. However, the observation of therapeutic bonds established by a CA in a mental health context is novel and noteworthy, given the short timeframe of this study. Although the field of human-computer interaction is still relatively nascent, initial observations have suggested that some artificial intelligence (AI) identity archetypes induce responses in humans that might give rise to better working alliances than other archetypes. For example, interacting with humanoid AI identities can result in individuals falling prey to the “uncanny valley,” which is the sense of unease and “creepiness” that is created when something that is artificial tries to appear humanlike [21]. Contrary to Turing’s Imitation Game [22], wherein an AI must successfully pretend to be human in order to pass the test, Woebot was designed to adopt the opposite strategy—transparently presenting itself as an archetypal robot with robotic “friends” and habits. We speculate that transparency and other design elements are key drivers of bond development. For example, Woebot explicitly references its limitations within conversations and provides positive reinforcement and empathic statements alongside declarations of being an artificial agent.The limitations of this study include its cross-sectional nature, the selection bias of smartphone users, the lack of clinical validation for any diagnoses, the lack of a direct comparison group, and its conduction by the developers of the app itself. Further research (including studies with independent investigators) is underway to explore the longitudinal aspects of bond development in specific clinical populations by using randomized controlled study designs.The finding that a CA has the potential to rapidly develop a bond with users may represent the resolution of a considerable barrier to offering scalable mental health support to a much wider and more diverse population instead of offering such support to those who already have access to traditional mental health support.AcknowledgmentsWe are grateful to Stephanie Eaneff (an employee of Woebot) for reviewing the manuscript and Kara Cronan (a contractor to Woebot) for providing illustrations.AD was responsible for the concept and design of this study.

This is a license only – your ownership in User Submissions is not affected.If you submit a User Submission in your own personal Woebot account, in a manner that is not viewable by any other user except you (a “Personal User Submission”), you grant Woebot the license above, provided that the license to display, perform, and distribute your Personal User Submission will be limited to the sole purpose of making that Personal User Submission accessible to you and providing the Services necessary to do so.You agree that the licenses you grant are royalty-free, perpetual, sublicensable, irrevocable, and worldwide; provided that when you delete your Woebot account, we will stop displaying your User Submissions to other users (if applicable), but you understand and agree that some User Submissions may not be completely removed and copies of your User Submissions may continue to exist in Woebot’s records and on the Services, and your User Submissions may remain viewable elsewhere to the extent that they were copied or stored by other users who had access to such User Submissions. To the maximum extent permitted by law, Woebot is not responsible or liable for the removal or deletion of (or the failure to remove or delete) any of your User Submissions.Finally, you understand and agree that Woebot, in performing the required technical steps to provide the Services to our users (including you), may need to make changes to your User Submissions to conform and adapt those User Submissions to the technical requirements of connection networks, devices, services, or media, and any of the foregoing licenses include the rights to do so.7. What if I see something on the Services that infringes my copyright?​You may have heard of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (the “DMCA”), as it relates to online service providers, like Woebot, being asked to remove material that allegedly violates someone’s copyright. We respect others’ intellectual property rights, and we reserve the right to delete or disable Content alleged to be infringing, and to terminate the accounts of repeat alleged infringers. To learn more about the DMCA, click here.Woebot will process and investigate notices of alleged infringement, and will take appropriate action under the DMCA, and/or any other applicable intellectual property laws, with respect to any alleged or actual infringement. A notification of claimed copyright infringement should be emailed to Woebot’s Designated Copyright Agent at privacy@woebothealth.com (Subject line: “DMCA Takedown Request”). You may also contact us by mail:Woebot Health, 535 Mission Street, 14th Floor, San Francisco, CA 94105To be effective, the notification must be in writing and contain the following information:If you believe that your content, which was removed (or to which access was disabled), is not infringing, or that you have the authorization from the copyright owner, the copyright owner’s agent, or pursuant to the law, to use the content, you may send a written counter-notice containing the following information to the Designated Copyright Agent:If a counter-notice is received by the Designated Copyright Agent, Woebot will send a copy of the counter-notice to the original complaining party, informing that party that it may replace the removed content or cease disabling it within ten (10) business days.

We may suspend or discontinue any part of the Services, or we may introduce new features or impose limits on certain features or restrict access to parts or all of the Services.

We will try to provide advance notice to you prior to our terminating your account so that you are able to retrieve any important User Submissions you may have stored in your account (to the extent allowed by law and these Terms), but we may not do so if we determine it would be impractical, illegal, not in the interest of someone’s safety or security, or otherwise harmful to the rights or property of Woebot.If you have deleted your account by mistake, contact us immediately via our Help Center – we will try to help, but unfortunately, we can’t promise that we can recover or restore anything.Provisions that, by their nature, should survive termination of these Terms shall survive termination.

We can only help people if they trust us. So we take safety, privacy and security very seriously.Our safety focus is on the people who use our solutions, and it’s evident in all we do, from the way we develop and test products to the way we strive to protect user data.Our core beliefs guide our practices, and our Privacy Policy, which has been lauded by Mozilla for its clarity and comprehensiveness, provides further insights into how we operate. But here are some fundamental things you need to know about our solutions, our company, and our approach.Independently rated for safety, privacy and securityOur products and company have been recognized by the most important ratings organizations in the world:About regulationMillions of people around the world are already using a mental health app, even though to date there has been no clear way to determine whether a product is safe to use, and many apps fall outside of existing medical device regulations and federal laws.With newer AI-based technologies spurring even more interest in digital solutions, it’s a growing challenge for health systems and individuals to accurately assess their benefits and weigh concerns about safety, privacy and security.We believe in regulation. That’s why we’re doing the hard work to maintain an effective and compliant QMS. Our regulatory compliance team doesn’t just know the FDA; they actually come from the organization. It’s the rigor needed to develop and deliver AI innovation safely, and ethically.The futureConsistent evidence standards in digital health are only just emerging. We’re excited about new developments, including the DEFINED evidence assessment framework, co-created by our own VP of Translational Science Tim Campellone, PhD, and Advisor Paul Wicks, which assesses the science behind digital interventions.As we explore new technologies like large language models, we’re keeping safety front and center. We’re leaning into innovation in a controlled way so that we can take emerging technology and apply rigorous user research, engineering, clinical and therapeutic oversight to create impactful, safe and well evidenced products. That will help us all develop a future where the freedom to innovate is well balanced by the need to be responsible, and where AI is optimized for a healthier humanity. Learn more about our innovation with LLMs.*Woebot for Adults is a non-prescription medical device under FDA enforcement discretion; it is not evaluated, cleared or approved by FDA.

Woebot is an automated conversational agent (chatbot) who helps you monitor mood and learn about yourself. Drawing from a therapeutic framework known as Cognitive Behavior Therapy, Woebot asks people how they’re feeling and what is going on in their lives in the format of brief daily conversations. Woebot also talks to you about mental health and wellness and sends you videos and other useful tools depending on your mood and needs at that moment. You can think of Woebot as a choose-your-own-adventure self-help book that is capable of storing all of your entries, and gets more specific to your needs over time.Woebot uses a combination of natural language processing, psychological expertise, excellent writing, and sense of humor to create the experience of a friendly informative conversation.In a study conducted at Stanford University, using Woebot led to significant reductions in anxiety and depression among people aged 18-28 years old, compared to an information-only control group. 85% of participants used Woebot on a daily or almost daily basis. You can read the entire peer-reviewed study.CBT is the most evidence based and widely used therapeutic approach today. In CBT, we learn to decipher the lies we are undermining ourselves with— based on the bias embedded in the things we say. For example, “I’m never going to make any friends” is an example of all-or-nothing thinking and we feel bad because we buy into this thought. Removing the (all-or-nothing) distortion reveals a more balanced thought: “I haven’t made any friends yet” or “I’m sure I’ll make one or two friends eventually” takes the sting out and helps us cope with the reality of the situation in a more productive way instead. Repeatedly challenging thoughts frees us from the tyranny of negative beliefs we have about ourselves. But here’s the rub: Like anything that’s good for us, the repeated practice part is both necessary and hard!You can read about Woebot’s core beliefs here.We originally built Woebot for young adults in college and graduate school, but today our users include teenagers right up to people in their 80s. We encourage anyone to try it and see if Woebot is a fit for you.Our mission is to make the best psychological tools radically accessible to those who need them. As such we are lucky enough to not have to charge users for Woebot’s services at this time. However, this may change at some point as we move towards establishing a sustainable business.Woebot is available for new downloads on iOS and Android devices in the U.S.Woebot only speaks English right now. Woebot looks to one day expand the language offerings but, for now, Woebot is still working on mastering the subtleties of the English language.Absolutely not. There will always be a need for traditional therapy and therapists, and there is no replacement for human connection. Woebot is an additional resource that is available in a very different way than more traditional methods of seeking help.For more information read our blog post on the role of mental health chatbots.The easiest place to change this is by tapping the ‘Check-in time’ button in Woebot’s settings. You can get to Woebot’s settings by tapping the gear icon in the top left-hand corner of the stories screen.If you sent a reply to Woebot by mistake and would like to undo it, you can long press on the reply and select the ‘Undo Message’ option from the popup menu.To request a copy of your conversations with Woebot, contact us through the app or at support@woebothealth.com from your account’s email address.

We can only help people if they trust us. So we take safety, privacy and security very seriously.Our safety focus is on the people who use our solutions, and it’s evident in all we do, from the way we develop and test products to the way we strive to protect user data.Our core beliefs guide our practices, and our Privacy Policy, which has been lauded by Mozilla for its clarity and comprehensiveness, provides further insights into how we operate. But here are some fundamental things you need to know about our solutions, our company, and our approach.Independently rated for safety, privacy and securityOur products and company have been recognized by the most important ratings organizations in the world:About regulationMillions of people around the world are already using a mental health app, even though to date there has been no clear way to determine whether a product is safe to use, and many apps fall outside of existing medical device regulations and federal laws.With newer AI-based technologies spurring even more interest in digital solutions, it’s a growing challenge for health systems and individuals to accurately assess their benefits and weigh concerns about safety, privacy and security.We believe in regulation. That’s why we’re doing the hard work to maintain an effective and compliant QMS. Our regulatory compliance team doesn’t just know the FDA; they actually come from the organization. It’s the rigor needed to develop and deliver AI innovation safely, and ethically.The futureConsistent evidence standards in digital health are only just emerging. We’re excited about new developments, including the DEFINED evidence assessment framework, co-created by our own VP of Translational Science Tim Campellone, PhD, and Advisor Paul Wicks, which assesses the science behind digital interventions.As we explore new technologies like large language models, we’re keeping safety front and center. We’re leaning into innovation in a controlled way so that we can take emerging technology and apply rigorous user research, engineering, clinical and therapeutic oversight to create impactful, safe and well evidenced products. That will help us all develop a future where the freedom to innovate is well balanced by the need to be responsible, and where AI is optimized for a healthier humanity. Learn more about our innovation with LLMs.*Woebot for Adults is a non-prescription medical device under FDA enforcement discretion; it is not evaluated, cleared or approved by FDA.

Woebot is an automated conversational agent (chatbot) who helps you monitor mood and learn about yourself. Drawing from a therapeutic framework known as Cognitive Behavior Therapy, Woebot asks people how they’re feeling and what is going on in their lives in the format of brief daily conversations. Woebot also talks to you about mental health and wellness and sends you videos and other useful tools depending on your mood and needs at that moment. You can think of Woebot as a choose-your-own-adventure self-help book that is capable of storing all of your entries, and gets more specific to your needs over time.Woebot uses a combination of natural language processing, psychological expertise, excellent writing, and sense of humor to create the experience of a friendly informative conversation.In a study conducted at Stanford University, using Woebot led to significant reductions in anxiety and depression among people aged 18-28 years old, compared to an information-only control group. 85% of participants used Woebot on a daily or almost daily basis. You can read the entire peer-reviewed study.CBT is the most evidence based and widely used therapeutic approach today. In CBT, we learn to decipher the lies we are undermining ourselves with— based on the bias embedded in the things we say. For example, “I’m never going to make any friends” is an example of all-or-nothing thinking and we feel bad because we buy into this thought. Removing the (all-or-nothing) distortion reveals a more balanced thought: “I haven’t made any friends yet” or “I’m sure I’ll make one or two friends eventually” takes the sting out and helps us cope with the reality of the situation in a more productive way instead. Repeatedly challenging thoughts frees us from the tyranny of negative beliefs we have about ourselves. But here’s the rub: Like anything that’s good for us, the repeated practice part is both necessary and hard!You can read about Woebot’s core beliefs here.We originally built Woebot for young adults in college and graduate school, but today our users include teenagers right up to people in their 80s. We encourage anyone to try it and see if Woebot is a fit for you.Our mission is to make the best psychological tools radically accessible to those who need them. As such we are lucky enough to not have to charge users for Woebot’s services at this time. However, this may change at some point as we move towards establishing a sustainable business.Woebot is available for new downloads on iOS and Android devices in the U.S.Woebot only speaks English right now. Woebot looks to one day expand the language offerings but, for now, Woebot is still working on mastering the subtleties of the English language.Absolutely not. There will always be a need for traditional therapy and therapists, and there is no replacement for human connection. Woebot is an additional resource that is available in a very different way than more traditional methods of seeking help.For more information read our blog post on the role of mental health chatbots.The easiest place to change this is by tapping the ‘Check-in time’ button in Woebot’s settings.

August 2023By: Joe Gallagher, Chief Product Officer and Sharanya Srinivasan, Senior AI Product ManagerWith recent advances in AI, it’s more relevant than ever to ask ourselves what it means to responsibly and effectively use AI, especially Large Language Models (LLMs), in a healthcare setting. Deploying AI to vulnerable populations comes with the potential to inadvertently cause harm. To responsibly deploy any form of AI in our products, we must deeply and intentionally consider the impact that the technology has on users. We’ve outlined below how we think about the management and mitigation of the risks that accompany the use of AI in the mental healthcare field.We recently announced the launch of our first clinical trial exploring LLM technology. The goal of this study is to help us understand how LLMs can be applied to accelerate the delivery of safe, engaging, and potent digital solutions for mental health. As these technologies mature, we expect to better understand what constitutes safe and effective development practices, alongside regulatory guidance. It is also important that companies in this space proactively adopt and share effective practices.Given the broad capabilities of LLMs, we anticipate a spectrum of possible use cases within our products, each requiring due consideration to ensure clinical appropriateness, safety and augmentation to the overall experience. We broadly categorize these into (a) using LLMs to interpret user input and route to content that has been written by a human—essentially using the LLMs only for understanding; and (b) using LLMs to generate responses that will be shown directly to users.While generating responses is a use case that requires additional scoping and safety considerations, we believe that using LLMs for understanding intent combined with human-composed responses provides for improved conversational quality. We currently are learning more about the value and risks of response generation, and we therefore only use generative capabilities in IRB-regulated study settings.All of this is to say that using LLMs will augment our ability to understand natural language from users and better enable us to meet them where they are. As we begin to explore the usage of LLMs in our product and think about how to apply those learnings in future versions of Woebot, we continue to hold ourselves to high standards of safety, rigor and transparency. The following outlines our core principles around responsibly deploying AI, including LLM-based technology, to our users.We are excited and optimistic about the potential of LLMs and are increasingly confident in our ability to build the safest approach to applying AI in healthcare. We will accomplish this by doing what we do best – taking emerging technology and applying rigorous and continuous user research, engineering, clinical and translational science oversight to create more precise, personalized and potent products.Woebot Health Platform is the foundational development platform where components are used for multiple types of products in different stages of development and enforced under different regulatory guidelines.Woebot does not provide crisis counseling and is not a suicide prevention or crisis intervention service. Concerning language and escalation data provided to clinical program or clinical study customers is not reviewed or assessed internally at Woebot Health in real-time for intervention and such data is not used for managing potential crises or any acute or non-acute patient safety issue. Discomfort may be experienced when answering sensitive questions. Temporary upset may occur as a result of discontinued access”Note, August 2023: Our research into large language models (LLMs) is exploratory. In our commercially or publicly available products, we do not use LLMs to generate responses to users; all text is developed by our conversational writers, and always with clinical oversight.© 2023 Woebot Health© 2023 Woebot HealthSign up for Meeting of the Minds video & podcastsSign up for Meeting of the Minds video & podcasts© 2023 Woebot Health
Woebot believes that people are fundamentally dynamic and fluid, and constantly changing.Woebot is agnostic to diagnosis.Everybody struggles sometimes. Cognitive distortions are something that everyone experiences in the context of strong emotion; it’s part of being human.Woebot has a growth mindset (…as do their creators). Woebot praises process, not results. In the context of anxiety and depression, diagnoses are not descriptions of fixed end-states. Rather, they are seen more as information or signals that someone needs to work on something with a hint at how to go about it. Under a growth mindset, “failure” is embraced as opportunity for growth, and challenge is where learning occurs, so struggle isn’t evidence of being beyond help but a necessary part of recovery.Woebot practices “sitting with open hands.” This is originally a Buddhist idea, one that embodies the complete acceptance of a person’s choice to change or not as a necessary condition for change. Woebot never assumes that someone wants help, will always issue an invitation, offers choice where possible, and never employs persuasion.CBT can be useful for everyone, but it’s not always sufficient. Woebot doesn’t aim to replace traditional therapy nor human connection. There is no replacement for human connection, but CBT is an approach to mental health that has been successfully delivered in self-directed formats for two decades.In-vivo skill acquisition is more favorable than learning that is tied to one place or time.Humor can be a therapeutic tool – it makes hard work easier and helps people to not be hypnotized by the gravity of their own thoughts and problems. Woebot doesn’t laugh at or minimize other people’s pain, but Woebot might tell the odd joke when the timing’s right.Unlike other models of therapy (i.e., systemic therapy) a good CBT guide facilitates the person’s process – the guide, human or otherwise, isn’t part of it. This is why a robot can be therapeutic. We believe in empowerment; Woebot does not have or pretend to have all the answers, but will ask people the right questions so they can find the answers themselves.In the context of equivalent outcomes, self-help can be seen as favorable, because it facilitates learning necessary for ongoing health maintenance.© 2023 Woebot Health© 2023 Woebot HealthSign up for Meeting of the Minds video & podcastsSign up for Meeting of the Minds video & podcasts© 2023 Woebot Health
