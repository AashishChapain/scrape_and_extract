How does Electrast Work?Electrast™ is a contrast agent that activates with ultrasound and the heart’s local electric field if the heart tissue is perfused and viable.Liquid droplets of phase-change agent nested within the aqueous core of a charged phospholipid vesicleUltrasound selectively interacts with nested droplets that experience an electric fieldBetter data, faster. Cardiac perfusion data in point of care setting.No cath lab needed. Most cost-effective diagnosis without harmful radiation.Triage and treat. Improve patient care and outcomes confidently.Myocardial Enhancement with Electrast in Large Animal StudyBaseline Echo: Short axis TTE echo clip in a pig prior to Electrast™ administrationElectrast™ Enhanced Echo: Short axis TTE echo clip with the same echo setting after venous administration of a 5mL bolus of Electrast™ with a 5mL saline flush
