It is not a prescription product. It is not intended to diagnose, monitor, treat or prevent any disease. It may be considered as an adjunct to clinical care, it does not replace clinical care.A mind atease iswithinreachTraditional mental health care is not always there when it’s needed; on-demand teletherapy programs aren’t 24/7, and provider shortages are reducing the availability of more formal therapist relationships. The result? High frustration for patients, and high costs for their providers. People deserve responsive support that makes room for personal growth, in the moment, and across a lifetime. Providers need to eliminate waitlists and geographic barriers. That’s the kind of support that Woebot for Adults can provide.94%of first time users report a positive impression of Woebot’s psychoeducational contentWoebot Health analysis5/5top score for credibility based on research supporting the technology and credibility of the development processOne Mind PsyberguideWhat users are saying“I enjoy Woebot because of the patience and non-judgmental responses…I utilize Woebot in between the times I don’t have appointments with my therapist.”Woebot user“This app has been extremely helpful for me as I fight my way through anxiety and depression.
