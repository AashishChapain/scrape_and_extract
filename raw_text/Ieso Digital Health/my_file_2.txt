Turning real-world clinical data into products that make mental healthcare more effective and accessible than ever before.ieso was established in the UK in 2000 by two psychologists passionate about using technology to create a world where everyone has access to effective mental healthcare. Since then, we’ve treated over 120,000 patients and built the world’s largest outcomes-indexed mental health dataset. We’re expert clinicians, scientists, and digital technologists blending data science and deep clinical expertise to create scalable, effective, and highly personalised digital mental health products.Our digital products are one-to-one programs available wherever, whenever, and at whichever stage of a person’s mental health journey. Data from the resulting interactions are securely collected and stored. Relevant deidentified data is then available to our clinical scientists and researchers, after applying requested opt-outs.We’ve collected data from over 650,000 hours of therapy sessions. We then use AI, machine learning and deep neural networks to recognise patterns in mental health conditions and treatment. For example, we’ve uncovered the need for more specificity in how we define mental health.This makes our treatments targeted and tailored, so they’re more likely to be effective and faster. And we’re committed to sharing our findings with the world by partnering with health systems, providers, and payers, and by publishing the highest quality academic research.Learn how ieso can easily integrate with your serviceSee our digital therapeutics product pipelineInterested to hear more about ieso? Get a demonstration of what we can do and how we can partner with you to transform mental health nowA globally unique outcomes-indexed mental health treatment dataset, in both quality and scale.Are you a health system, provider, or payer looking to improve access to mental healthcare, reduce treatment costs and help people get better, faster?‍Read our latest news, research and articles written by people shaping the future of mental healthcare.For this spotlight interview, we spoke to Arif Hussain about his role as Customer Success Manager.Nature Mental Health journal publishes research on health economics conducted by ieso, Dorset Healthcare University NHS Foundation and York Health Economics Consortium.Economic evaluation of 27,540 patients with mood and anxiety disorders and the importance of waiting time and clinical effectiveness in mental healthcareOur latest blog looks at how recognising a mental health issue early on and understanding why it might be happening means that we can put steps in place before it dramatically impacts your life.ieso AI Scientist Lily Battershill gives TED Talk at St. George's Edinburgh YouthProfessor Lucy Chappell visited ieso Digital Health headquarters in CambridgeWe are pleased to announce that we are collaborating with The University of Manchester to understand which subgroups of people with diabetes could benefit most from digital psychological therapy.For this year's UK Mental Health Awareness Week and as part of US Mental Health Awareness Month, our latest blog looks at ways you can support someone with feelings of anxiety.We spoke to Bethan Zalantai, ieso's US Care Operations Manager, for our latest spotlight interview.For our latest spotlight interview, we speak to Deborah Cleary about her role as Head of Payer Development at ieso.For World Health Day, take a look at how digital therapy can help provide Health For All.For our latest spotlight interview, we speak to Malika Bouazzaoui about her role as Clinical Development Lead.For our International Women’s Day spotlight interview, we speak to ieso’s Daniella Quinn about her role as a Clinical Scientist.ieso features in The New Yorker’s article on the use of AI in digital mental health treatment.Our Chief Operating Officers for the UK and US, Clare Hurley and Dr Jodi Prohofsky, sat down to talk about the similarities of the opportunities and challenges for the DTx industry in both countries.For this spotlight interview, we speak to Dr Clare Palmer about her role as Director of Evidence Generation.ieso’s Director of Mental Health Research, Dr Louise Marshall, welcomes the launch of Nature Mental Health journal by the Springer Nature Group.Dave Icke has joined the company as Executive Chair.
