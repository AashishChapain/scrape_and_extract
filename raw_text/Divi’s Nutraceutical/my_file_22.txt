The microalgae are grown in a 3-step process in a totally closed system:The purpose of the first phase is to grow a healthy biomass.During the next stage, the algae are exposed to stressors such as extreme sunlight and starvation. As a response to these stressful environmental condition, the algae produce astaxanthin, in order to preserve their DNA in an undamaged state, and turn a deep red color.After this phase the biomass is dried and the astaxanthin is extracted from the Haematococcus pluvialis using only carbon dioxide.The result is a vivid red carotenoid which is then formulated into beadlets for easy handling.Please fill out the formular.
