The use of hard-shell capsules has several advantages: they ensure the controlled release of the ingredients, different capsule sizes are available on the market, as well as a wide variety of colors. They even allow the printing of texts or pictograms which facilitate the identification of the product.Hard-shell capsules are used for the encapsulation of both hydrophilic and lipophilic ingredients while ensuring good stability over time. Additionally, they provide good absorption rates and can act as an effective solubilizing matrix.Divi’s beadlets and powders present excellent stability during encapsulation and throughout the shelf life of the capsule, limiting the need for overages in the initial formulation. They facilitate handling thanks to their excellent flowability.For all fine powders where uniformity is a key performance parameter, Divi’s Nutraceuticals uses a new cutting-edge technology to make unique mini beadlets. Our Mini-Beads provide excellent stability and grant excellent uniformity in a range of applications.Divi’s uses an exclusive microencapsulation process to produce Mini-Beads, which are about 30% finer than regular beadlets for superior uniformity in fine powders like premixes.In order to help our customers meet consumer demand for less additives, Divi’s offers product forms that are formulated with healthy oils and contain no sugar, no synthetic antioxidants and no silicon dioxide.To help our customers target consumer demand for additive-free supplements, our range also includes silicon dioxide-free product forms.Please fill out the formular.
