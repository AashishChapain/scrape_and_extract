A member of the FTSE 100, Entain’s brands have a combined heritage of a staggering 250 years.To deliver great customer experiences, Entain knew they had to first deliver great employee experiences. So in 2020, they partnered with Unmind to empower their international workforce to proactively nurture their mental health.Fast-forward to 2022, when Entain ran a global survey to assess their full wellbeing ecosystem. They discovered an eye-opening link between manager conversations and employee burnout. The more regular, open and authentic conversations people had with managers, the less people experienced burnout.The need for manager training, at scale, was clear. And so Entain entered the next chapter of their partnership with Unmind: the gaming giant rolled out our industry-leading Workplace of Tomorrow training course across their retail population.Stella Gavinho, Group Head of Wellbeing, who championed the initiative, explains: “We wanted to help managers nurture the right conversations and better support their teams, so giving them access to Unmind Managers was a no-brainer.”Unmind Managers is training done differently. It’s all about building cultural wellbeing rituals and equipping managers to have supportive conversations, giving practical support on topics that really matter –such as self-care, managing stress and anxiety, financial wellbeing and understanding neurodiversity.“It is very easy to say, ‘you should have more conversations’,” says Stella, “but you need to give people the skills and confidence to do that. You have to lay the foundations  on mental health and give everyone the same basic skills.”The results have been immediate and striking. The stats  speak for themselves.Managers also reported that they felt more able to spot when a colleague might be struggling with their mental health, more confident in their ability to nurture their team’s mental health, and better equipped to help a colleague  who needed it.Employees are reaping the rewards of a healthy Mental Health & Wellbeing culture. Managers have been giving  the training rave reviews. Thomas Brooks, Retail Learning Business Partner, said,  “It's fantastic to hear so much positive feedback for this training -  a massive win.”“We wanted our managers to have the basic skills to create that culture of psychological safety," says Stella, "Ultimately this leads to happier and better performing teams."“Managers need to start by focusing on their own mental health. No one can help other people if they’re not looking after themselves.”Leonie MoretonDEI Business Partner, MediacomHow Arup’s senior buy-in and internal comms drove a powerful shift in wellbeing culture with UnmindGreat minds don’t think alike: What we can learn from Silicon ValleyUnmind 2023 Summer ReleaseIntroducing Unmind HelpFrom the Unmind Lab: Tackling low mood and depressionSolutionsScienceClientsResources & eventsCompanyCopyright © 2023 | Unmind Inc | All rights reserved.
