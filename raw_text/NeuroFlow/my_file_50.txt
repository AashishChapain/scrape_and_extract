NeuroFlow streamlines this process by building critical infrastructure and providing care team support to simplify integration, adapting to unique organizational needs.Today’s process for supporting behavioral health fails both patients and providers, as the overwhelming demand for behavioral health services strains limited resources and ultimately PCPs are left to manage escalating issues on their own.NeuroFlow alleviates resource bottlenecks by providing the foundational building blocks providers need to successfully execute integrated care. Our technology empowers universal screening, digital self-management tools, and risk stratification. These tools allow healthcare organizations to address behavioral health issues early, take stress off the referral system, and match individuals to the right level of care.
