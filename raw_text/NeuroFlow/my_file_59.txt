Future research will be key to enhancing behavioral health technology and integration to further improve patient outcomes and reduce emergency department utilization.Stats at a glance:See related case studyClick to view studySummary: The use of measurement-based care in integrated care settings offers a means to address existing treatment gaps for individuals with mental health disorders seeking care. Findings from this study demonstrate the large-scale feasibility (n > 4,000) of remotely collecting mental health data via a mobile technology platform and that changes in depression and anxiety symptoms, including suicidal ideation, can be reliably assessed. Findings further revealed that digitally-enabled measurement-based care (MBC) supported patients experiencing moderate, moderately severe, or severe depression or anxiety in achieving clinically and statistically significant symptom improvements.Stats at a glance:See related research: Counselor and student perceptions of an mHealth technology platform used in a school counseling settingClick to view studySummary: The ability to risk stratify a patient population to inform population level interventions is key to efficient, high quality, measurement-based care. Current methodologies focus predominantly on validated assessments alone, without consideration of other qualitative measures of symptom impact on functionality. This study details the development of the NeuroFlow Severity Score (NFSS) and evaluates its utility for population level risk stratification when compared to the Personal Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) and Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7), and expert clinician review.  Based on over 35,000 NeuroFlow users, the NFSS demonstrates the simultaneous credibility and clinical validity of a comprehensive single risk index while reducing effort and burden for clinicians.Stats at a glance:Be sure to check this page regularly for our latest updates regarding our ongoing research efforts!Terms of Service | BAA | Privacy Policy | CCPA | SubprocessorsCopyright © NeuroFlow. 2022.
